# Deep Reinforcement Learning in The Real World

This repository lists the many places deep reinforcement learning is used in the world. Feel free to contribute additions to this list, and we will filter through them and accept the ones that seem to fit the criteria of real-world reinforcement learning.


## The list

For each item, please include two parts, a link to an article or video to make the application clear and easy to read for the average person. Second, include a link to the paper or technical report (preferably free) that provides further details and its relation to other work (if it is available). See the posts below for examples of this format.
